My name is Tanner Gildea and I work in government data science. Most recently, I worked on the digital analytics team for [the Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/).

In a former life, I worked in electoral politics. I was a member of the state analytics team for the [Democratic Party of Wisconsin](https://wisdems.org) and [Biden for President](https://joebiden.com) campaign. In the November 2020 election, our small but mighty data team helped secure President Biden's [tipping point victory](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-swing-states/) in the Badger State. Before that, I worked as an organizer on the [Mayor Pete Buttigieg](https://peteforamerica.com) presidential campaign in New Hampshire and Virginia. Working on the 2020 campaign trail was the honor & privilege of a lifetime.

I graduated from Harvard with a degree in Social Studies. I primarily studied political science and social theory and wrote an honors thesis on the foreign policy rhetoric of American presidents. During my time at school, I was involved with the [Harvard College Democrats](http://harvarddems.org), [Harvard Model Congress](https://www.harvardmodelcongress.org), and the [Institute of Politics](https://iop.harvard.edu). I also spent a summer conducting qualitative and quantitative research in the [Office of the New York Attorney General](https://ag.ny.gov).
