title: About

My name is Tanner Gildea and I am originally from the suburbs south of Boston, MA.

I recently graduated from Harvard with a degree in Social Studies. I primarily studied government and social theory, and wrote an honors thesis on the foreign policy rhetoric of American presidents. During my time at school, I was involved with the [Harvard College Democrats](http://harvarddems.org), [Harvard Model Congress](https://www.harvardmodelcongress.org), and the [Institute of Politics](https://iop.harvard.edu).

Most recently, I spent time working in the [Office of the New York Attorney General](https://ag.ny.gov), where I conducted qualitative and quantitative research. I hope to join a 2020 campaign in the near future.
