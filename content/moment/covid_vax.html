<p>The U.S. Covid-19 vaccination campaign began in earnest in December, 2020 after the dual emergency use authorizations of the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-takes-key-action-fight-against-covid-19-issuing-emergency-use-authorization-first-covid-19">Pfizer-BioNTech</a> and <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-takes-additional-action-fight-against-covid-19-issuing-emergency-use-authorization-second-covid#:~:text=The%20emergency%20use%20authorization%20allows,years%20of%20age%20and%20older.">Moderna</a> mRNA vaccine candidates. The vaccines contain “a small piece of the Covid-19 virus’s mRNA that instructs cells in the body to make the virus’s distinctive ‘spike’ protein. After a person receives this vaccine, their body produces copies of the spike protein, which does not cause disease, but triggers the immune system to learn to react defensively, producing an immune response against SARS-CoV-2.”</p>

<p>Though the vaccines were <a href="https://learningenglish.voanews.com/a/how-covid-19-vaccines-developed-in-record-time/5703115.html">developed and approved in record time</a>, the vaccine distribution campaign is off to a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/biden-talk-covid-harris-gets-vaccine-n1252464">slow and concerning start</a>. Though the federal government’s <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/coronavirus/explaining-operation-warp-speed/index.html">Operation Warp Speed</a> fell far short of its <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/12/31/952208601/u-s-likely-will-miss-goal-of-vaccinating-20-million-by-the-new-year">initial goal to deliver 20 million vaccinations</a> by the end of December, improvements in distribution make it quite clear the U.S. will hit the Biden administration’s goal of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/dec/08/joe-biden-coronavirus-vaccine-health-team">100 million vaccine doses in his first 100 days</a>. It now appears Biden is aiming for 1.5 million doses per day in his 100 days, which again, seems reasonable if not certain.</p>
<p>But forget goals - what if the U.S. distributed all the vaccine supply promised to it by Moderna and Pfizer (220 million doses by end of Q1 2021)? We could hit herd immunity be early June.</p>

<h1>When Will the U.S. Achieve Herd Immunity?</h1>

<p><img src="/moment/covid_vax_files/figure-html/projected_herd_timeline-1.png" width="120%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The majority of public health experts have estimated general herd immunity is achieved somewhere around <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/herd-immunity-and-coronavirus/art-20486808">70% protection</a>, though some experts have recently estimated that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-usa/fauci-says-herd-immunity-could-require-nearly-90-to-get-coronavirus-vaccine-idINL1N2J411V">higher protection rates</a> are necessary.</p>
<p>The percent to herd immunity calculations presented in the figure above assume this 70% protection rate and some form of <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2020/coronavirus-antibodies-protect-against-future-infection#:~:text=Using%20real%2Dworld%20data%20from,being%20reinfected%20with%20the%20virus%20.">protection against reinfection</a> from Covid-19 antibodies. While the true herd immunity protection threshold may be higher than 70%, the true number of U.S. Covid-19 cases may also be <a href="https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/news-media/research-highlights/us-covid-19-cases-may-be-substantially-underestimated/">substantially underestimated</a>.</p>

<p><span class="math display">\[\sum_{n=a}^{i} C_n +  \sum_{n=b}^{i} \frac{V_n}{2}+ \sum_{n=i}^{D} (\frac{\hat V_n}{2} + \hat C_n) = .70*USpop\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[\text{and:}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(a = \text{date of first Covid-19 case}\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(i = \text{today&#39;s date}\)</span></p>

<p><span class="math inline">\(USpop = 330,000,000\)</span></p>
<p>Such uncertainty could lead to herd immunity being achieved either more quickly or more slowly than projected above. Thus, these figures are meant to illustrate a rough approximation of the country’s progress towards herd immunity, rather than a definitive projection.</p>
<p><strong>At the rolling seven-day average vaccination and case rates, the U.S. is projected to achieve herd immunity September 29, 2021.</strong> All assumptions considered, this is likely a conservative date - assuming single-dose vaccines are introduced into distribution from Johnson &amp; Johnson and/or AstraZeneca, and the rate of daily vaccinations continues to increase.</p>
<p>What is more certain is that to achieve herd immunity by Covid-19 infection alone, as some <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/16/trump-appointee-demanded-herd-immunity-strategy-446408">fringe public health commentators</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-coronavirus-scott-atlas-herd-immunity/2020/08/30/925e68fe-e93b-11ea-970a-64c73a1c2392_story.html">right-wing politicians</a> have previously suggested the U.S. do, <strong>approximately 10,446,983 more Americans would die!</strong></p>
