<p>The U.S. Covid-19 vaccination campaign began in earnest in December, 2020 after the dual emergency use authorizations of the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-takes-key-action-fight-against-covid-19-issuing-emergency-use-authorization-first-covid-19">Pfizer-BioNTech</a> and <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-takes-additional-action-fight-against-covid-19-issuing-emergency-use-authorization-second-covid#:~:text=The%20emergency%20use%20authorization%20allows,years%20of%20age%20and%20older.">Moderna</a> mRNA vaccine candidates. The vaccines contain “a small piece of the Covid-19 virus’s mRNA that instructs cells in the body to make the virus’s distinctive ‘spike’ protein. After a person receives this vaccine, their body produces copies of the spike protein, which does not cause disease, but triggers the immune system to learn to react defensively, producing an immune response against SARS-CoV-2.”</p>

<h1>Estimated U.S. Percent to Goal of Achieving Herd Immunity</h1>
<p><img src="/moment/covid_vax_files/figure-html/herd%20immunity%20map-1.png" width="120%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p><img src="/moment/covid_vax_files/figure-html/projected_herd_timeline-1.png" width="120%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The majority of public health experts have estimated general herd immunity is achieved somewhere around <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/herd-immunity-and-coronavirus/art-20486808">70% protection</a>, though some experts have recently estimated that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-usa/fauci-says-herd-immunity-could-require-nearly-90-to-get-coronavirus-vaccine-idINL1N2J411V">higher protection rates</a> are necessary.</p>
<p>The percent to herd immunity calculations presented in the figure above assume this 70% protection rate and some form of <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2020/coronavirus-antibodies-protect-against-future-infection#:~:text=Using%20real%2Dworld%20data%20from,being%20reinfected%20with%20the%20virus%20.">protection against reinfection</a> from Covid-19 antibodies. While the true herd immunity protection threshold may be higher than 70%, the true number of U.S. Covid-19 cases may also be <a href="https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/news-media/research-highlights/us-covid-19-cases-may-be-substantially-underestimated/">substantially underestimated</a>.</p>
<p>Such uncertainty could lead to herd immunity being achieved either more quickly or more slowly than projected above. Thus, this figure is meant to illustrate a rough approximation of the country’s progress towards herd immunity, rather than a definitive projection.</p>
<p><strong>At the rolling seven-day average vaccination and case rates, the U.S. is projected to achieve herd immunity June 23, 2021.</strong></p>
<p>What is more certain is that to achieve herd immunity by Covid-19 infection alone, as some <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/16/trump-appointee-demanded-herd-immunity-strategy-446408">fringe public health commentators</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-coronavirus-scott-atlas-herd-immunity/2020/08/30/925e68fe-e93b-11ea-970a-64c73a1c2392_story.html">right-wing politicians</a> have previously suggested the U.S. do, <strong>approximately 10,232,264 more Americans would die!</strong></p>
