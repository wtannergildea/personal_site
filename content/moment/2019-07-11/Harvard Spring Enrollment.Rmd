Using archived Harvard enrollment data, I have isolated the ten spring courses that have experienced the largest absolute increase in undergraduate enrollment since 2016. President Bacow, you should pay particular attention to departmental support and funding for these courses. These courses are at risk of failing to adequately meet rising undergraduate demand.
