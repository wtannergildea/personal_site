<p>Enrollment in Harvard courses fluctuates year to year, but a few classes catch fire from time to time. Whether by way of timely material or a star teaching team, the size of some classes can swell exponentially.</p>
<p>Using archived Harvard University <a href="https://registrar.fas.harvard.edu/faculty-staff/courses/enrollment/archived-course-enrollment-reports">enrollment data</a>, I isolated the ten spring courses in 2019 that have experienced the largest absolute increase in undergraduate enrollment since 2016. Interested students should look at course reviews on the <a href="http://q.fas.harvard.edu">Q Guide</a> to see what the hype is all about. On the other hand, college administrators should pay particular attention to these courses for additional departmental support and funding. Otherwise, they are at risk of failing to adequately meet rising undergraduate demand.</p>
